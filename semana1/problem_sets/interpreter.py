# Implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein: x is an integer y is +, -, *, or / z is an integer For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

def main():
    expression = input("Expression: ")
    x, y, z = expression.split()
    x = int(x)
    z = int(z)
    
    if y == "+":
        result = x + z
    elif y == "-":
        result = x - z
    elif y == "*":
        result = x * z
    elif y == "/":
        result = x / z
    
    print(f"{result:.1f}")
